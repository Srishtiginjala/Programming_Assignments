# Programming_Assignments
This repository contains programming assignments of various courses.

Currently they include:

IC252- Datascience-2 It deals with discrete and continuous random variables and inequalities associated with them( WLLN, CLT). It also touches upon methods of estimation and hypothesis testing.

IC272- It discusses data preprocessing techniques like normalization and PCA and touches upon classification algorithms like KNN,Bayes Classifier and Gaussian Mixture Model. It also covers regression algorithms( Linear, Polynomial and Auto Regression) and various clustering techniques like K-Means, DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering. Finally it also introduces basics of neural networks (Feedforward neural nets).
